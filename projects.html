                        <p>In this project, I worked alongside two friends to create a small database that holds professor records, student records, and a variety of other entities with their respective attributes. To lay out the framework for this project, we began by designing both an ER Diagram and Relational Model as our schemas in order to help us structure our database entitities and their relations. Once this was complete, we utilized MySQL for our database tables, and populated them with sample data. Next, I worked on the front-end design of the website, utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 to create pages and forms to test user queries. Four queries are accessible, and I subsequently used PHP to link the user's input with our database, in which their requests would be processed and the desired results would be dispalyed.</p>

                        <p>Within this project, I worked with a long-time friend of mine to create a fully functional Matrix Calculator. This calculator is capable of performing basic matrix operations such as matrix addition, matrix subtraction, and scalar multiplication. However, it is also capable of more complex operations such as matrix inversion and matrix multiplication. To turn this idea of ours into a reality, we utilized various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the ReactJS library, with the entirety of the project being developed in VSCode.</p>

                        <p>A C++ console-based game written with Visual Studio that utilizes Windows Console API functions to create a rudimentary graphical interface. This project did not use any special graphical libraries, and instead creates a graphical interface from the ground upâ€”relying on basic color manipulation of select portions of the console screen. This interactive hangman game features a fully-functional menu interface, difficulty menu, and a credits sequence amongst other graphics and functions.</p>

This completed project was a product of many hours of thoroughly studying and analyzing the ins and outs of HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Web Design as a whole. However, despite the many hours of labor that went into the design and construction of this website, it was truly a lot of fun to make, and it is currently compatible with a multitude of devices, including mobile devices, laptops, and larger monitors as well.</p>
